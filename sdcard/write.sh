Welcome to the write to sd card process!
This script will allow you to:
	- Write an os to a SD Card
	- Customize for a specific type of board
	- Insert files and configuration via a a prepopulated rootfs, so your os works out-of-the-box!

Required arguments:

sdcard/write.sh [disc or sd card] [boot] [os]

Optional argument:

sdcard/write.sh [disc or sd card] [boot] [os] [rootfs]

Explanation:
	disc - The SD Card place, often /dev/sdb or something. Run 'fdisk -l' to see what letter you sd card have.
	boot - The type of board you have
		- Currently supported:
			- rpi - For Raspberry Pi A, A+, B, B+
			- rpi-2 - For Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
			- parallella - The Adepteva Parallella board. Note: Awfully slow. Do not use as-is. But you're welcome to hack and improve it. Should have a newer kernel
			- cubietruck - Feel free to test and return bugs. @luxas doesn't have a cubie, so he can't test it.
	os - The operating system which should be downloaded and installed.
		- Currently supported:
			- archlinux - Arch Linux ARM
	rootfs - Prepopulated rootfs with scripts and such.
		- Currently supported: 
			- kube-archlinux - Kubernetes scripts prepopulated (optional)

Example:
sdcard/write.sh /dev/sdb rpi-2 archlinux kube-archlinux
