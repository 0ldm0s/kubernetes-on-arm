#### luxas/raspbian was removed in v0.7.0

Earlier it served as a debian-ish base with helper methods.
It was based on `resin/rpi-raspbian:jessie`, which now is used instead.
Other alternatives are `armhf/debian` and `armel/debian`

`luxas/raspbian` is available on Docker Hub for compability, but is not used in the kubernetes-on-arm code.
