# luxas/bench

Uses Roy Longbottoms Raspberry Pi benchmarks.
This image compiles them, executes them, and collects most of the data.
Then it runs a C++ script, which summarizes and calculates the benchmark data.
The reference point: 100 p, Raspberry Pi 1.
When a Raspberry Pi 1 executes this benchmark, it gets 100 p in every benchmark.

So, that way one knows how much better other ARM boards are, compared to a RPi 1.
