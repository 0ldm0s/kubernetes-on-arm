# Welcome to the Kubernetes on ARM project!

#### Kubernetes on a Raspberry Pi?
#### Is that possible?

#### Yes, now it is. 	
Imagine... Your own testbed for Kubernetes with cheap Raspberry Pis.

#### **Are you convinced too, like me, that cheap ARM boards and Kubernetes is a match made in heaven?**		
**Then, lets go!**

## Download and build a SD Card

The first thing you will do, is to create a SD Card for your Pi.
The only supported operating system at the moment is Arch Linux ARM.
The installer will write Arch Linux ARM to your SD Card, and include some Kubernetes scripts!

 - Step 1: Insert the SD Card into your computer
 - Step 2: Open a Linux command line, e. g. Ubuntu Terminal
	- Windows downloads coming soon...
 - Step 3: Install git in order to download this project, e. g. `sudo apt-get install git`
 - Step 4: Check which letter you SD Card has, similar to `/dev/sdb`
	- Run `sudo fdisk -l` to list all hard drives connected to the computer


```bash
# Go to our home folder (optional)
cd ~

# Download this project
git clone https://github.com/luxas/kubernetes-on-arm

# Change to that directory
cd kubernetes-on-arm

# Write the SD Card, replace X with the real letter
# Replace `rpi-2` with `rpi` if you have an Raspberry Pi 1.
# We're specifying that we want `archlinux` as operating system.
# We also want Kubernetes scripts in our new SD Card image so `kube-archlinux` should be there
sudo sdcard/write.sh /dev/sdX rpi-2 archlinux kube-archlinux

# The installer will ask you if you want to erase all data on your card
# Answer y/n on that question
# Prepend the command with QUIET=1 if no security check should be made
# Requires an internet connection
# This script runs in 3-4 mins
```

## Setup your board

Start your Raspberry Pi		
Log into it. The user/password is: **root/root** or **alarm/alarm**		
Yes, I know. Root enabled via ssh isn´t that good.
But for the moment this task is left as an exercise to the user.
These scripts requires root. So if you login via **alarm**, then `su root` when you´re going to do some serious hacking :)

```bash
# This script will install and setup docker etc.
kube-config install

# The script will ask you for timezone. Defaults to Europe/Helsinki
# Run "timedatectl list-timezones" to check for values

# It will ask you if it should create a 1 GB swapfile.
# If you are gonna build Kubernetes on your own machine, you have to create this

# It will ask for which hostname you want. Defaults to kubepi.

# Last question is whether you want to reboot
# You must do this, otherwise docker will behave very strange and fail

# If you want to run this script non-interactively, do this:
# TIMEZONE=Europe/Helsinki SWAP=1 NEW_HOSTNAME=mynewpi REBOOT=0 kube-config install
# This script runs in 2-3 mins
```


## Build the Docker images for ARM

We will be setting up Kubernetes in a Docker container, so we have to build some images.	
I´m working on getting pre-built images up on Docker Hub so in the future, one may skip this step.

But for the moment this step is mandatory.

```bash

# Build all master images
kube-config build-k8s

# This script will take approximately 45 min on a Raspberry Pi 2
# Grab yourself a coffee during the time!

```

The script will produce these Docker images: 	
 - luxas/raspbian: Is a stripped `resin/rpi-raspbian` image. [Docs coming soon...]()
 - luxas/alpine: Is a Alpine Linux image. Only 8 MB. Based on `mini-containers/base`. [Docs coming soon...]()
 - luxas/go: Is a Golang image, which is used for building repositories on ARM. [Docs coming soon...]()
 - kubernetesonarm/build: This image downloads all source code and builds it for ARM. [Docs coming soon...]()

These images are used in the cluster:
 - kubernetesonarm/etcd: `etcd` is the data store for Kubernetes. Used only on master. [Docs coming soon...]()
 - kubernetesonarm/flannel: `flannel` creates the Kubernetes overlay network. [Docs coming soon...]()
 - kubernetesonarm/hyperkube: This is the core Kubernetes image. This one powers your Kubernetes cluster. [Docs coming soon...]()
 - kubernetesonarm/pause: `pause` is a image Kubernetes uses internally. [Docs coming soon...]()



## Setup Kubernetes

Everything have to be compiled to ARM. Fortunately this is possible, sometimes easily, with Go.		
There is a script, called `kube-config`

```bash

# To enable the master service, run
kube-config enable-master

# To enable the worker service, run
kube-config enable-worker

# The "enable-worker" script will ask you for the ip of the master
# Write in the ip address and you´re done!


```


## Use Kubernetes

After you have built the images, `kubectl` will be available.


```bash

# Some examples

# Get info about your machine and Kubernetes version
kube-config info

# Build an nginx image
kube-config build luxas/nginx

# Make an replication controller with our image
# Hopefully you will have some minions, so you is able to see how they spread across hosts
kubectl run my-nginx --image=luxas/nginx --replicas=3

# See that the nginx container is running
docker ps

# See which pods are running
kubectl get pods

# See which nodes we have
kubectl get nodes

# Expose the replication controller "my-nginx" as a service
kubectl expose rc/my-nginx --port=80

# See which ip we may ping, by getting services
kubectl get svc

# See if the nginx container is working
# Replace $SERVICE_IP with one ip "kubectl get svc" returned 
curl $SERVICE_IP

```

## Known issues

After a reboot, the `etcd` service doesn´t work properly. But I´m working on it.


## Future work

I will try to compile [RancherOS](https://github.com/rancher/os) to this project also.

Add support for Banana Pro and Parallella.

And lots of other interesting things...

## Goals for this project

This project ports [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) to the ARM architecture.	
The primary boards used for testing is Raspberry Pi 2´s.

My goal for this project is that it should be as small as possible, while retaining its flexibility.	
It should also be as easy as possible for people, who don´t know anything about Kubernetes, to get started.

It should be easy in the future to add support for new boards and operating systems.

#### Feel free to create an issue if you find a bug or think that something should be added or removed!
