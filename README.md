# Welcome to the Kubernetes on ARM project!

Kubernetes on a Raspberry Pi?
Is that possible?
Yes, now it is.
Imagine... Your own testbed for Kubernetes with cheap Raspberry Pis.


**Are you too convinced, like me, that cheap ARM boards and Kubernetes is a match made in heaven?**
**Then, lets go**













This project ports [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) to the ARM architecture.
The primary board used for testing is a Raspberry Pi 2.

My goal for this project is that it should be as small as possible, while retaining its flexibility.
