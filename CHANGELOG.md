   - Add a http loadbalancer. Thanks for the help @larmog
   - **Upgrade to and support docker-1.10.0 only**
   - **Kubernetes Dashboard UI added as an addon**
   - Do not depend on pacman, use a self-built statically linked ARMv6 docker-1.10 binary instead
   - Revert to userspace proxying, since iptables proxying had some bugs in it
   - Better documentation
   - A worker may now reboot and come up again in some minutes
   - Better UX when writing the hypriot image, caches the downloaded image for faster writes and installs unzip if not present
   - Bug fixes
   - Rearranged the addon manifests
 - v0.6.3
   - Fix bugs and make the `.deb` file stable
   - Add an experimental `.tar.gz` deployment for platforms that doesn't have `dpkg`
   - Document the /etc/kubernetes/README.md better
   - Refactor, fix bugs and remove unnecessary things
   - Break out the DNS options `cluster.local` and `10.0.0.10` to `/etc/kubernetes/k8s.conf`
   - Fixed so the master is able to collect logs from nodes @kyletravis
   - Better DNS management on Arch Linux
   - Use a shell for looking up paths to executables needed in `.service` files
   - Easier to use on `systemd`, most of the packages is automatically installed

   - Support for Banana Pro
   - `.deb` package deployment
   - `iptables` proxying mode for `kube-proxy` should result in better performance
   - `docker` is built statically for both `ARMv6` and `ARMv7`. Optional to use in most cases.
   - **Support for HypriotOS**
   - Support for plain `systemd` OSes
   - Enabled experimental Kubernetes by default, e.g. `Jobs`, `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`
   - k8s => 1.1.3, etcd => 2.2.2, flannel => 0.5.5, registry => 2.2.1
   - **Started to hack on mainline k8s: [kubernetes/kubernetes#17981](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/17981)**
   - Renamed `kube-archlinux` to the more generic `kube-systemd`
   - Small improvments and much better README
   - Bug fixes
   - Broke out the flannel subnet to the configuration file: `/etc/kubernetes/k8s.conf` supports now `FLANNEL_SUBNET` which defaults to `10.1.0.0/16`
 - v0.6.0
   - A new, more customizable way to write the SD Card, allows for more OSes in the future
     - Automates post-installation for cubietruck.
   - Upgrade k8s => 1.1.2, flannel => v0.5.4, etcd => 2.2.1, registry => 2.2.0, go => 1.4.3
   - Now it's possible to build the Kubernetes binaries with Go 1.5.1, but it's much slower so it's not default
   - Add some test scripts for even more automation
   - Fix the bug that makes this not run on armv6, e.g. Raspberry Pi 1
   - Add windows downloads
   - Now `ServiceAccount` `secrets` are working as they should
     - Make dns use ServiceAccount tokens
   - `kube-proxy` runs in a container under `kubelet` on master
   - Now it's possible to reboot and k8s restarts automatically
   - Many small bugfixes and improvments
 - v0.5.8

   - Now cubietruck is supported
   - Kubernetes binaries are now downloaded from Github, this makes it also possible to use k8s out-of-docker
   - Bugfixes, especially when running `kube-config enable-*`
   - Now the installer also may download images from Github
   - Added lots of new info to `kube-config info`
   - Added `kube-config upgrade` for upgrading the system
   - Added the `sleep` addon. [README](addons/sleep/README.md)
